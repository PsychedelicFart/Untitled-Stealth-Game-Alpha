Untitled-Stealth-Game-Alpha
===========================

This repository is made to put an open source copy of the alpha version of my stealth game.

All source code can be taken from the project files, cost-free. Be warned, all script files are build using the Unity API, this means you must plug these files into Unity in order to work.
